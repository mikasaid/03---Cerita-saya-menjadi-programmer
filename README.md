The long story of my life and career journey until I was able to become a programmer in several big technology companies in Indonesia.

I broke this story into several parts because it is quite long to be made into one article. Read the whole story at the following link:

Part 1 - The story of a village boy becoming a programmer
Part 2 - The story of labor to become a programmer
Part 3 - My story of being a programmer - you are here
I dedicate this article to those who are studying to become Programmers or Software Engineers, to those who are newbies, to those who are fresh graduates who often complain about how difficult it is to learn programming.

How I Became a Programmer
I am lucky to have and close with almost all my college friends, one of them is Lukman Hakim (currently a software engineer at Tiket.com). Since college I've been trying to get to know my college friends and trying to find out their background and work. This Lukman seemed to be the only college friend of mine who worked as a programmer at the time. Knowing this and reflecting on my weakness in computer practice and programming, I tried to get closer to Lukman since I was in college. I tried several times to help when Lukman had difficulty understanding various theoretical lessons and I asked him questions about practice and programming myself.

After graduating and at that time I was still working as a bakery worker, Lukman invited me to try to apply for a job as a Programmer even though he knew at that time I was still very ignorant of that world. And even more fortunate because the one who did the interview at that time (Om Rio - the late) was Lukman's superior, who trusted him so much because I was Lukman's reference, in the end just chatted and asked questions about how my college was, there was no logic test, any coding or testing.

SML Technologies
SML Technologies
Being able to join SML Technologies as a Java Programmer gave me a lot of lessons, I met many people who to this day are still like mentors to me. Many people I consider extraordinary came from this office as well. In my early days in SML, I helped develop their desktop application product which was built with Java Swing as the interface and JavaEE behind it. Then about a year later and the product was successfully launched, finally asked to help the web team, to work on several web dashboards
I've been struggling with Java Swing for almost a year, but I just realized that I don't know anything about web development. Yep, of course this started when I started getting assignments to help other friends to work on web dashboard projects from SML clients. It turns out I don't know how HTML is created, I don't understand how CSS works, what is the correlation with HTML, let alone the various "magic" of JS. I was like a kid in the middle of a pack of hungry wolves, even though I had been a Java programmer for a year. I was lucky, at that time SML was a very conducive place to work while studying, I was able to keep working, get paid and learn about things that support my work. Of course, they are guided by people who are more skilled and first jump in their fields.

Fortunately, I've worked for many years as a coolie and laborer, for me it's still easier to learn programming when it's difficult than working as a laborer in the past. I may be stupid and have to learn a lot of things compared to other friends but this doesn't necessarily make me give up. I have a wife and children that I have to support, I still have to make sure that I can perform well in the office so that I can get a decent salary increase the following year .

Therefore, even though it is considered the most awkward among the others in terms of web programming, it does not make me discouraged. I ask questions when I don't know, I try to understand many fundamentals of web programming, I also don't hesitate to "disturb" a friend's work so that problems that I am confused or don't know can be solved together. I did this for months when I was initially asked to help the web team.

I was dealing a lot with JS at that time, because we adopted the ExtJS Framework to create various web dashboards so that my JS knowledge was honed a lot even though I missed a lot of basic HTML and CSS in the end.
